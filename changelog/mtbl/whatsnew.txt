  - New function MTblGetOrigParentRow
    Gets a row's original parent row.

***** V 2.1.2
 - Item concept
   With this version, the item concept has been introduced.
   An item is a functional class which identifies a table object (e.g. a cell) or a part of a table object (e.g. a cell image).
   Most of the new functions in this release are using this new item class.

   It's planned to replace item specific functions with generic item functions in the next releases.
   For example, the functions MTblSetCellBackColor, MTblSetColHdrGrpBackColor, MTblSetColumnBackColor, MTblSetColumnHdrBackColor, MTblSetCornerBackColor,
   MTblSetRowBackColor and MTblSetRowHdrBackColor would be replaced by a single function: MTblSetItemBackColor.
   Such replacements would lead to a clearer API.
   Don't worry, the old functions would continue to exist (for backward compatibility).

    If set, the clipboard isn't used to set cell data in Excel.
    Instead, the cell data is set directly by "Range.SetFormulaLocal".
    Setting the cell data directly is somewhat slower, but it avoids that - as some users reported - sometimes "Worksheet.PasteSpecial" throws an exception.

  - New excel flag MTE_EXCEL_NO_AUTO_FIT_COL
    If set, the Excel method "AutoFit" isn't performed on columns

  - New excel flag MTE_EXCEL_NO_AUTO_FIT_ROW

  - New message MTM_QueryExcelValue
    This message is sent once for every exported cell while exporting to Excel.
    If you return a value ( a string converted to a number by SalHStringToNumber ),
    M!Table uses the returned value rather than determining the value of appropriate cell.

  - New message MTM_QueryExcelNumberFormat
    This message is sent once for every exported column and cell while exporting to Excel.
    If you return a format ( a format string converted to a number by SalHStringToNumber ),
    M!Table sets the appropriate cell(s) in Excel to the specified number format before pasting the cell data.
    If a format for a numeric column is returned, M!Table exports all cells of the column unformatted.

 - New message MTM_QueryExcelColWidth
    This message is sent once for every exported column while exporting to Excel.
    If you return a value != 0, M!Table sets the width of the appropriate column in Excel.
    The desired value needs to be multiplied by 100 (to be able to use 2 fractional digits).

 - New message MTM_QueryExcelRowHeight
    This message is sent once for every exported row while exporting to Excel.
    If you return a value != 0, M!Table sets the height of the appropriate row in Excel.
    The desired value needs to be multiplied by 100 (to be able to use 2 fractional digits).

  - Automatic calculation
    For performance reasons, automatic calculation in Excel is switched off during the export.
    The original setting is restored after the export.

 - MTblObjFromPoint
  - New flag MTOFP_OVERCOLHDRSEP
    Is set if the mouse is over a column header separator.

 - Windows Themes
   M!Table now provides a better support for Windows Themes.
   All child controls ( buttons, drop down buttons, checkboxes etc. ) are drawn according to the current Windows Theme.
   Furthermore, the default colors of the current Windows Theme are used.
   You can disable this behaviour by setting the (new) table flag MTBL_FLAG_IGNORE_WIN_THEME.

 - Buttons
  - New button flag MTBL_BTN_LEFT
    If set, the button is left aligned
  - New button flag MTBL_BTN_NO_BKGND
    If set, the button is drawn without background
  - New button flag MTBL_BTN_FLAT
    If set (and no Windows Theme is used), the button is drawn with a flat border
  - Added "3D effect" for M!Table buttons
    If a M!Table button is clicked, text and image move 1 pixel to the right/bottom (if no Windows Theme is used or MTBL_BTN_NO_BKGND is set)

 - Word Wrap
   If a cell has more than 1 row because of merging and the column flag COL_MultilineCell is set, 
   the text is displayed with automatic line breaks and the editing mode is multiline.

 - New table flags
  - MTBL_FLAG_IGNORE_WIN_THEME
    If set, M!Table ignores the current Windows Theme.
    All child controls ( buttons, drop down buttons, checkboxes etc. ) are drawn according to the classic style.
    Furthermore, the default colors of the classic style are used.
  - MTBL_FLAG_BUTTONS_FLAT
    If set (and no Windows Theme is used), all M!Table and drop down buttons in the table are drawn with a flat border


***** V 2.0.0
 - Localization
   Added support for custom languages (language files).

   Hence, M!Table itself also uses language files for the default languages:
   German => mtbllang.de
   English => mtbllang.en

   Please note that you have to distribute these files with your application, otherwise M!Table will not function properly.

   - New functions:

      MTblPrint returns this value if the specified language is invalid 
      

 - Tooltips
   The tooltip window is now created when it's needed and destroyed if it's no longer needed.
   This saves window ressources in applications with many tables.

***** V 1.9.9
 - General
  - Initial Memory consumption
    The initial memory consumption caused by subclassing was reduced dramatically (from ~3664 KB to ~196 KB).
    This was achieved by using dynamic instead of static memory allocation for (16384) column objects.
    However, the effective memory consumption will grow the more column objects are created.
    But because most tables don't have more than 200 columns, also the effective memory consumption will be reduced dramatically!

 - Tree
  - New tree flag MTBL_TREE_FLAG_INDENT_NONE
    If set, rows on level 0 are not indented and have no nodes.

 - Buttons
   Buttons ( M!Table buttons and drop down buttons ) now can be shown permanently by setting the new table flag MTBL_FLAG_BUTTONS_PERMANENT.
   If permanent buttons are switched on by the table flag, they can be switched off
   on column level by setting the flag MTBL_COL_FLAG_HIDE_PERM_BTN
   or on cell level by setting the flag  MTBL_CELL_FLAG_HIDE_PERM_BTN.

   Permanent buttons can be hidden in non editable cells ( disabled or read only ) by setting the new table flag MTBL_FLAG_HIDE_PERM_BTN_NE.
   If permanent buttons are hidden in non editable cells by the table flag, they can be still shown
   on column level by setting the flag MTBL_COL_FLAG_SHOW_PERM_BTN_NE
   or on cell level by setting the flag  MTBL_CELL_FLAG_SHOW_PERM_BTN_NE.

 - Cell mode
   New flag MTBL_CM_FLAG_NO_SELECTION
   If set, cells are never selected.

   New message MTM_QueryNoFocusOnCell
   This message is sent when the cell focus is about to change due to a keyboad action or a mouse click.
   If a value != 0 is returned, the cell doesn't receive the focus.

 - Dropdown lists
   New table flags MTBL_FLAG_USE_TBL_FONT_DDL.
   If this flag is set, the table font is used for dropdown lists instead of the effective cell font.

   From now the following VisList*Value functions can be used:
   VisListAddValue, VisListFindValue, VisListGetValue, VisListInsertValue and VisListSetValue.

 - Popup edits
   New table flags MTBL_FLAG_USE_TBL_FONT_PE.
   If this flag is set, the table font is used for popup edits instead of the effective cell font.

 - Hit test
   New M!Table flags MTblObjFromPoint:
   MTOFP_OVERBTN ( is set when the mouse is over a permanently visible M!Table button )
   MTOFP_OVERDDBTN ( is set when the mouse is over a permanently visible drop down button )

 - Cell images
   MTblSetCellImage/MTblSetCellImageExp: New flag MTSI_NOTEXTADJ
   If this flag is set, the cell text will not be adjusted because of the cell image.
